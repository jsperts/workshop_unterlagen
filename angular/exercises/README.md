# Exercises for Angular 2

These exercises are part of our [Angular 2 + TypeScript Workshop](https://jsperts.de/workshops/schulungen-seminare/angular2-typescript-workshop-02-2017)

## Prerequisites

All exercises use [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) so you first need to install that globally:

```
npm install -g angular-cli
```

Now install (in each directory) all dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

* You can start the API-Server with `npm run start:json`
* You can start a Webserver which builds and serves the individual exercises with `ng serve`
